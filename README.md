⚗️ I am a Chemical Engineer by training,

💻 but currently on a not-so-undercover research mission posing as a Computational Biologist

🌊 I grew up next to the sea, so I decided to move to the seaside city of Barcelona, Spain for my PhD

👩‍🎓 so now I am a PhD student at the [Epitranscriptomics and RNA Dynamics lab](https://www.crg.eu/ca/programmes-groups/novoa-lab), at the Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG).

🐍 I mainly write in R because it's easy on my engineer brain;<br />Python is fun too

💎 I use Obsidian as a second brain, and sometimes I write code for it that I publish [to this repo](https://github.com/LedaKatopodi/obsidian-scripts-n-snippets)

🎨 Graphic design is my passion, so you bet I spend an hour choosing the perfect font

🖌️ ggplot and BioRender are my besties

🎟️ I have discovered that emojis help me navigate through a repo so,<br />bear with me, my repo READMEs are filled with emojis

📸 I also like to find a photo that vaguely expresses the theme of each repo

🐳 I really really really like whales, so much that
* I wanted to become a Marine Biologist (so close yet so far) 
* seeing them irl is one my favorite memories
* I currently own about 20 whale-inspired or whale-themed items
* one of the coolest papers I have read is on whales, with the coolest title: [Return to the Sea, Get Huge, Beat Cancer: An Analysis of Cetacean Genomes Including an Assembly for the Humpback Whale](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/8/1746/5485251)

🐱 Yes, I am a cat person; yes, I am slightly allergic to cats; no, I won't stop petting them
