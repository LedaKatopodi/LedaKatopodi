Hi~! This is Leda, and here are some stuff about me:

⚗️ I am a Chemical Engineer by training, but currently on a not-so-undercover research mission posing as a Computational Biologist
🌎 Contrary to logic or biology, I have migrated to colder climates, from Athens, Greece to Boston, MA
🏛️ I am currently a Research Student and Bioinformatician at the Ioannis Vlachos Non-Coding Research Lab at Harvard Medical School

🐳 I love whales, so I wanted to grow up and become a Marine Biologist (so close yet so far); I have seen whales irl and it was one of the best experiences in my life; I currently own about 20 whale-insired or whale-themed items; and one of the coolest papers I have read has the coolest title: [Return to the Sea, Get Huge, Beat Cancer: An Analysis of Cetacean Genomes Including an Assembly for the Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/8/1746/5485251)
🐈‍⬛ Yes, when I cut my bangs I look like the cat in the profile pic; yes, I am a cat person; yes, I am slightly allergic to cats

🎟️ I have discovered that emojis help me navigate through a repo more easily so, bear with me, my repo READMEs are filled with emojis; I also like to find a photo that vaguely expresses the theme of each repo
💎 I use Obsidian as a second brain, and sometimes I write code for it: https://github.com/LedaKatopodi/obsidian-scripts-n-snippets
🎨 Graphic design is my passion, so you bet I spent an hour choosing the perfect font; ggplot and BioRender are my besties
